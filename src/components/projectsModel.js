        "description": "My plants/succulents don't like the cold so they have to be brought inside during the winter. But how would they get enough light, I wondered? That sounded like an automation project to me! I bought some lights and borrowed a few wireless remote controlled power outlets. Using an open source project, I programmed a Raspberry Pi to send signals that would turn on/off the outlet. Next, I set up a cron job to send the correct signal at the designated time of day. My plants now flourish during the winter! During the off season, I use it in a similar way to start seedlings."

        "description": "I have known that I would like a new job for some time, but I always seemed to get bogged down in the details. A couple months ago I was sitting in an agile workshop and the idea came to me - why can't I apply this to finding a new job? I knew what I wanted to accomplish but needed help with the structure. This framework provided a written down plan and the ability to watch my progress - two things that are big motivators for me. All of this with the added benefit of practicing agile principles too! I initially had a handful of job related tasks/PBIs. As I knocked those off, I saw myself get more motivated and begin to scope out more items. Early on, I realized that Scrum wouldn't be the ideal approach so I adopted Kanban instead. I'm continuing to refine my process, but I've already accomplished more since I started than I had in the prior 2 years combined."

I looked at the book later that night, even bought an e-book version, but it required a fairly extensive self-inventory to help the reader figure out what they wanted and 'I just didn't have the time'. Fast forward to early this year - I was ready to bite the bullet and find a new job. And not just any job - I wanted a job I'd love and enjoy, something I'm passionate about. So, I re-read the book, created my own workbook for the self-inventory and spent a few months going through it. And I'm glad I did. It has further inspired me to look for a new job and to not settle for one that falls short of my key passions and skills. The images on the left are a few pages from the completed workbook."

        "description": "As you can probably tell from the rest of my site, I have a thing for plants. I continue to expand my balcony garden and check it every day; I 'blame' my parents and growing up on a farm for this love of growing things. As I was trying to remember if I needed to fertilize or just water one day, I recalled learning about a Microsoft project that recognizes plants and recommends certain measures for more efficient growth/production. I started talking to my friend, and we came up with this idea to create our own app that would monitor a garden, recognize the plants and best care for them, and notify the user as needed (fertilize, weather, plant needs care, etc). Around this time, I finished up the parachute book and realized that something like this at large scale - pairing technology with my love of plants - would be my ideal career. My friend and I are still ironing out details, but I am really looking forward to working on this. There's a lot to learn!"
