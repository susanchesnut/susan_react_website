        "description": "My plants/succulents don't like the cold so they have to be brought inside during the winter. But how would they get enough light, I wondered? That sounded like an automation project to me! I bought some lights and borrowed a few wireless remote controlled power outlets. Using an open source project, I programmed a Raspberry Pi to send signals that would turn on/off the outlet. Next, I set up a cron job to send the correct signal at the designated time of day. My plants now flourish during the winter! During the off season, I use it in a similar way to start seedlings."

Then I was sitting in an agile workshop and the idea came to me - why can't I apply this to finding a new job? I knew what I wanted to accomplish but needed help with the structure. This framework provided a written down plan and the ability to watch my progress - two things that are big motivators for me. All of this with the added benefit of practicing agile principles too! I initially had a handful of job related tasks/PBIs. As I knocked those off, I saw myself get more motivated and begin to scope out more items. Over the last year, this process has helped me achieve a lot of my goals."

        "description": "After admitting that I wasn't sure I was in the right field to an instructor a few years ago, he recommended I read <i>What Color is Your Parachute</i> by Richard Nelson Bolles. I looked at the book later that night, even bought an e-book version, but it required a fairly extensive self-inventory to help the reader figure out what they wanted and 'I just didn't have the time'. Fast forward a year - I was ready to bite the bullet and find a new job. And not just any job - I wanted a job I'd love and enjoy, something I'm passionate about. So, I re-read the book, created my own workbook for the self-inventory and spent a few months going through it. And I'm glad I did. It further inspired me to look for a new job and to not settle for one that falls short of my key passions and skills. The images on the left are a few pages from the completed workbook."
